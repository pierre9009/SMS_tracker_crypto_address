# SMS_tracker_crypto_address


This code allows to retrieve all the transactions made by a crypto address on 4 different blockchains.
By modifying the code you will be able to receive sms alerts of the transaction and their amounts.

2 bash scripts are optional for a potential application on a raspberry pi, the both need to be launch at starting.

the sms commands are here made to work with a french operator, you will have to find an alternative if you are not with free (operator).

To set up this code on a raspberrypi :

-change the rc.local file to start the both bash script
-you need to be sure that all the file are in the same directory as descibe in all the code, you may change some line about directory.
-Need to be sure that all the file are executable (chmod +x programm.py)
