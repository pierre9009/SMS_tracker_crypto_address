# SMS_tracker_crypto_address


This code allows to retrieve all the transactions made by a crypto address on 4 different blockchains.
By modifying the code you will be able to receive sms alerts of the transaction and their amounts.

2 bash scripts are optional for a potential application on a raspberry pi, the both need to be launch at starting.

the sms commands are here made to work with a french operator, you will have to find an alternative if you are not with free (operator).




issue: the start bash file is to start python scripts and restart them every hour because python files eventually die.
